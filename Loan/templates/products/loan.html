The tenure for personal loan ranges from 1 year to 5 years. When taking a personal loan, the borrower is not required to disclose the reason behind taking the loan. The loan is generally taken to pay one time or short term immediate financial expenses. People take a personal loan to fulfill immediate or emergency financial needs.
